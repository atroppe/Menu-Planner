###Description
If you do a lot of cooking, planning menus can become tedious and time consuming even if you love to cook. I chose to create "My Menu Planner" to add some fun to the task of planning menus, while providing myself with a flexible subject to review what I have learned in this course. "My Menu Planner" is a responsive, single page application that is built using parse to store data. The user can choose from four visual themes and then browse different categories of recipes.
